### Epicurean Canonics

The purpose of this class is to familiarize the student with the fundamental doctrines of Epicurean canonics, which is the equivalent in philosophical terminology of "epistemology" - or more informally, the issue of how we know what we think we know. When this course is complete, the student will know both the major doctrines of Epicurean canonics and a general idea of how those doctrines compare with ancient and modern alternative theories.
